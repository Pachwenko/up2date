                    <span>The PSF and the Python Steering Council are pleased to announce that the inaugural Developer-in-Residence role will be held by core developer ≈Åukasz Langa. 
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is developed and primarily maintained by volunteers. Inspired by the Django Fellowship Program&#x27;s success, the PSF has strategically planned to support CPython in a similar way beginning this year. Thanks to the support from sponsors such as Google, this effort is now being put into motion!¬†
≈Åukasz will work full-time for one year to assist CPython maintainers and the Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will include analytical research to understand the project&#x27;s volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project priorities and their tasks going forward, and begin working on those priorities. Regular reporting and full transparency to the community are also a large part of ≈Åukasz‚Äô role. If the program is impactful and the PSF raises enough funds, there is potential for the Developer-in-Residence role to continue beyond one year. We look forward to updating the community as work progresses!

                    <span>Today the Ember project is announcing release 3.27 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. This is a minor version, stable release.
We&#x27;re also announcing the start of the 3.28 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a stable release in six weeks&#x27; time. The ember-try addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.
Ember.js 3.28 (again, starting beta today) is the final planned version of the 3.x release cycle, and will
become an LTS release. As of the 3.28-beta being released, the main development
branch of all Ember projects will become 4.0. Look for more information on Ember
4.0 here on the blog this coming week.

New release of Unstable Ember Language Server, share code snippets on Twitter using Ember, the difference between ember serve and npm run start, and an addon roundup!
Release of uELS v2.0.16 ‚úÖ
Unstable Ember Language Server is a fully featured fork of Ember Language Server. While the name says unstable it actually has been stable and ready to use for day-to-day development!
Thanks to both Alex LaFroscia (@alexlafroscia) and Alex Kanunnikov (@lifeart) for new version release which provides:
Support workspace/didChangeConfiguration event
Improved startup speed by delaying template tokenization
Autocomplete now use global registry and file change events, not fs lookup, but we still do fs lookup on project initialization

                    <span>In accordance with our security release policy, the Django team
is issuing
Django 3.2.5 and
Django 3.1.13.
These releases address the security issue with severity &quot;high&quot; detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2021-35042: Potential SQL injection via unsanitized QuerySet.order_by() input
Unsanitized user input passed to QuerySet.order_by() could bypass intended
column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a
potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted.
As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the
duration of the deprecation period. This regression appeared in 3.1 as a side
effect of fixing #31426.
The issue is not present in the main branch as the deprecated path has been
removed.
Thanks to Joel Saunders for the report.
Affected supported versions
Django 3.2
Django 3.1
Resolution
Patches to resolve the issue have been applied to Django&#x27;s 3.2 and 3.1
release branches. The patches may be obtained from the
following changesets:
On the 3.2 release branch
On the 3.1 release branch
The following releases have been issued:
Django 3.2.5 (download Django 3.2.5 | 3.2.5 checksums)
Django 3.1.13 (download Django 3.1.13 | 3.1.13 checksums)
The PGP key ID used for this release is Mariusz Felisiak: 2EF56372BA48CD1B.
General notes regarding security reporting
As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django&#x27;s
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see our security
policies for further
information.</span>

Faith Or (@faith-or) wrote a blog post on how they migrated from ember-wormhole to the built-in in-element helper introduced in Ember 3.20.
Ember Wormhole is an addon that renders a child view somewhere else in the DOM outside of the component.
The in-element helper renders its block content outside of the regular flow, into a DOM element given by its destinationElement positional argument.
Common use cases for both include when a piece of UI is a logical child of a component but needs to render somewhere else such as a loading screen, a modal, tooltip or even a dropdown. The diffe‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>After ten years of exceptional service to the Python Software Foundation, the PSF Executive Director Ewa Jodlowska has decided to leave the Foundation at the end of 2021. We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It‚Äôs safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa.
In preparation for Ewa‚Äôs departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission ‚Äúto promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.‚Äù
The Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.</span>
