                    <span>After 3.5 years and 28 minor releases, Ember 3.28 marks the end of the project&#x27;s 3.x series.
To ensure a smooth upgrade path going into the 4.x series, 3.28 has been declared an LTS (Long Term Support) candidate. In six weeks,
the latest patch version of 3.28 will be promoted to be the latest LTS release
and replace 3.24-LTS.
We&#x27;re also announcing the start of the Ember 4.0 beta cycle for all sub-projects. Following the process set in previous major versions, Ember 4.0&#x27;s beta introduces no new features. Instead, it removes support for deprecated public APIs. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a stable release in six weeks&#x27; time. We also encourage everyone to help maintainers resolve deprecations in‚Ä¶</span>

Release: ember-engines-router-service, ember-scroll-modifier and ember-user-activity updates, and Coding with the Dead on Twitch.
‚öôÔ∏è Release: ember-engines-router-service
Michael Villander (@villander) released the ember-engines-router-service addon which provides the Router service for ember-engines.
The addon gives you access to the RouterService API inside each engine. This allows you to inject the router service as usual to your component within an engine and use APIs such as transitionTo and even transitionToExternal which help link externalRoutes together.
import Component from &#x27;@glimmer/component&#x27;;
import { inject as service } from &#x27;@ember/service&#x27;;
import { action } from ‚Äò@ember/object‚Äô;

export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
  @service router;

                    <span>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is excited to welcome Shamika Mohanan as our new Packaging Project Manager! You can learn specifics about the role in our post announcing the position.

Recognizing that the success of the Python language and community relies on the success of its packaging ecosystem, the PSF is excited for the Packaging Project Manager role to facilitate, coordinate, and amplify the existing momentum in this space.

Shamika will be performing outreach to Python users to help the PSF better understand the landscape, identify fundable initiatives, seek grants, oversee funded projects, and report on their progress and results to improve Python packaging for all users. Shamika will also work with the PSF Director of Infrastructure to make progress on developing PyPI into a sustainable service that the community can continue to rely on for years to come.

Once again we want to thank our Visionary Sponsor Bloomberg for their initiative in ‚ÄúShifting Left‚Äù and supporting this role for its initial term of two years.</span>

Read the blog post on Avoiding Lifecycle in Components, announcing Glimmer Apollo, new release for ember-responsive-image, and code in public: Ember dev streaming on Twitch.
Blog post: Avoiding Lifecycle in Components ‚úçÔ∏è
NullVoxPopuli (@NullVoxPopuli) published a blog post on Avoiding Lifecycle in Components, namely the lifecycle hooks that come with ember-render-modifiers.
For some context, ember-render-modifiers was created from RFC 415: Render Element Modifiers which introduced  three new generic element modifiers: {{did-insert}}, {{did-update}}, and {{will-destroy}}. The caveat however was that these modifiers were meant for quickly migrating away from classic Ember components to Glimmer components, because they largely allow you to use the same lifecycle hook methods‚Ä¶</span>
