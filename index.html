                    <span>The second day of the 2021 Python Language Summit finished with a series of lightning talks from Ronny Pfannschmidt, Pablo Galindo, Batuhan Taskaya, Luciano Ramalho, Jason R. Coombs, Mark Shannon, and Tobias Kohn.



Annotated Assertions: Debugging With Joy
Ronny Pfannschmidt spoke about annotated assertions. He is a pytest maintainer and loves approachable debugging.
He compared assertions in unittest with assertions in pytest. He remarked that mistakes have been made in the past and are still being made today. Before pytest 2.1, pytest would reinterpret assertions, which was bad for side effects. Today, pytest deals with side effects by handling all of the variables, collecting them, and showing them to you.¬†
Here&#x27;s what he would like to see in Python:



Here&#x27;s what he&#x27;d like to do:

What Is Testing?
For the purposes of this talk, he defined testing as the art and science of running code and then checking if it did what it was supposed to do. He added that, although assertions, type checkers, linters, and code review are good, they are not testing.
There are two general reasons why we might have tests:

For correctness:

The goal is to validate software and determine that they are no bugs.
Nondeterminism is acceptable.
Finding any fault is a success. 

For software engineering (programming, over time, in teams):

The goal is to validate changes or detect regr‚Ä¶</span>

What Does the Community Need? 
When Eric Snow first got involved in core development over a decade ago, he liked that there was so much to learn. But he found that the organization didn&#x27;t offer a lot of direction in terms of guiding volunteers to the kind of work that would have the biggest impact.¬†
Over the years, he&#x27;s thought about how he and other contributors decide what to work on and why. What directs the efforts of contributors and core developers? Contributors make decisions based on their availability, expertise, and interests. Core developers need to act as s‚Ä¶</span>

¬†
What Is the stdlib? 

He succinctly described the stdlib as &quot;a collection of modules that ship with CPython (usually).&quot; This was the most accurate definition he could give, considering how big it is, how varied its contents are, and how long it has been around.
He didn&#x27;t offer an answer to the question about whether or not there should be a new informational PEP to define clear goals for the stblib, but he wanted core developers to engage with the question. There are a variety of opinions on the stdlib, but it could be beneficial to come to some kind of agreement about:

Why Does Python Need a Documentation Work Group?
The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to advance the Python language and grow a diverse, international community of Python programmers so that the language can continue to flourish well into the future. However, when it comes to documentation, core developers don&#x27;t necessarily reflect the larger world of Python users. If we can bring together core developers, documentarians, and educators, then we can have better documentation that serves the needs of the wider community m‚Ä¶</span>

What Is Python Like on Debian and Ubuntu? 

He shared what Debian 11 and Ubuntu 21.04 have installed for Python. By default, there is almost nothing, so it&#x27;s usually pulled in by various seeds or images. Linux distributions usually have a mature packaging system and don&#x27;t ship naked CPython, unlike macOs or Windows.

¬†
The Stable ABI and Limited C API
Petr Viktorin spoke about the stable ABI and limited C API. The stable ABI is a way to compile a C extension on Python 3.x and run it on Python 3.x+. It was introduced in 2009 with PEP 384. You can use it to simplify extension maintenance, and it will allow you to support more versions. But it does have lower performance, and you can&#x27;t do everything with it that you could with the full API.
Petr Viktorin would like to see it used for bindings and embeddings. If Python is just a small part of your application and you don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of maintainer time into supporting Python, then that woul‚Ä¶</span>

What Is HPy?
HPy is an alternative API for writing C extensions. Although the current Python C API shows CPython implementation details, HPy hides all the implementation details that would otherwise be exposed. Antonio Cuni said that, if everyone used HPy, then it would help Python evolve in the long term.
Using HPy extensions will make it easier to support alternative implementations. HPy is designed to be GC friendly and isn&#x27;t build on top of ref counting. It is also designed to have zero overhead on CPython, so you can port an existing module from the Python‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>At the 2021 Python Language Summit, Guido van Rossum gave a presentation about plans for making CPython faster. This presentation came right after Dino Viehland&#x27;s talk about Instagram&#x27;s performance improvements to CPython and made multiple references to it.

Can We Make CPython Faster?
We can, but it&#x27;s not yet clear by how much. Last October, Mark Shannon shared a plan on GitHub and python-dev. He asked for feedback and said that he could make CPython five times faster in four years, or fifty percent faster per year for four years in a row. He was looking for funding and wouldn&#x27;t reveal the details of his plan without it.
How Will We Make CPython Faster? 

Seven months ago, Guido van Rossum left a brief retirement to work at Microsoft. He was given the freedom to pick a project and deci‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Dino Viehland gave a presentation at the 2021 Python Language Summit about improvements to CPython&#x27;s performance at Instagram. 

Cinder is Instagram&#x27;s internal performance-oriented production version of
CPython 3.8, so all of the comparisons in this presentation dealt with Python 3.8. Cinder has a lot of performance optimizations, including
bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time
JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler that uses type annotations to emit
type-specialized bytecode that performs better in the JIT.
Successful Improvements
Instagram did a lot of work with asynchronous I/O. One big change was sending and receiving values without raising StopIteration. Raising all of those exceptions was a huge source of overhead. On simple benchmarks, t‚Ä¶</span>

For those who know the project well, this will come as no surprise. It‚Äôs no secret that we think that accessibility is an integral part of quality code. Ember.js is committed to providing a well-lit path for developer success, and our plans to make it easier for developers to write accessible code are part of that. In 2020, the Ember Accessibility Strike Team became the Ember Accessibility Working Group, demonstrating our commitment to long-term accessibility growth in the framework.

                    <span>Victor Stinner and Dong-hee Na gave a presentation at the 2021 Python Language Summit about running multiple Python interpreters in parallel in the same process.




Use Cases 

Victor Stinner started by explaining why we would need to make the changes that they&#x27;re discussing. One use case would be if you wanted to embed Python and extend the features of your application, like Vim, Blender, LibreOffice, and pybind11. Another use case is subinterpreters. For example, to handle HTTP requests, there is Apache mod_wsgi, which uses subinterpreters. There are also plugins for WeeChat, which is an IRC client written in C.

Embedding Python
One of the current issues with embedding Python is that it doesn&#x27;t explicitly release memory at exit. If you use a tool to track memory leaks, such as Valgrind‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>PEP 654 was authored by Irit Katriel, Yury Selivanov, and Guido van Rossum. This PEP is currently at the draft stage. At the 2021 Python Language Summit, the authors shared what it is, why we need it, and which ideas they rejected.


¬†What Is PEP 654?


The purpose of this PEP is to help Python users handle unrelated exceptions. Right now, if you&#x27;re dealing with several unrelated exceptions, you can:


Raise one exception and throw away the others, in which case you&#x27;re losing exceptions

Return a list of exceptions instead of raising them, in which case they become error codes rather than exceptions, so you can&#x27;t handle them with exception-handling mechanisms
Wrap the list of exceptions in a wrapper exception and use it as a list of error codes, which still can&#x27;t be handled with exception-‚Ä¶</span>
