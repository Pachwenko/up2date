New release of Unstable Ember Language Server, share code snippets on Twitter using Ember, the difference between ember serve and npm run start, and an addon roundup!
Release of uELS v2.0.16 ‚úÖ
Unstable Ember Language Server is a fully featured fork of Ember Language Server. While the name says unstable it actually has been stable and ready to use for day-to-day development!
Thanks to both Alex LaFroscia (@alexlafroscia) and Alex Kanunnikov (@lifeart) for new version release which provides:
Support workspace/didChangeConfiguration event
Improved startup speed by delaying template tokenization
Autocomplete now use global registry and file change events, not fs lookup, but we still do fs lookup on project initialization
Added template-lint severity support

                    <span>In accordance with our security release policy, the Django team
is issuing
Django 3.2.5 and
Django 3.1.13.
These releases address the security issue with severity &quot;high&quot; detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.
CVE-2021-35042: Potential SQL injection via unsanitized QuerySet.order_by() input
Unsanitized user input passed to QuerySet.order_by() could bypass intended
column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a
potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted.
As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the
duration of the deprecation period. This regression appeared in 3.1 as a side
effect of fixing #31426.
The issue is not present in the main branch as the deprecated path has been
removed.
Thanks to Joel Saunders for the report.
Affected supported versions
Django 3.2
Django 3.1
Resolution
Patches to resolve the issue have been applied to Django&#x27;s 3.2 and 3.1
release branches. The patches may be obtained from the
following changesets:
On the 3.2 release branch
On the 3.1 release branch
The following releases have been issued:
Django 3.2.5 (download Django 3.2.5 | 3.2.5 checksums)
Django 3.1.13 (download Django 3.1.13 | 3.1.13 checksums)
The PGP key ID used for this release is Mariusz Felisiak: 2EF56372BA48CD1B.
General notes regarding security reporting
As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django&#x27;s
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see our security
policies for further
information.</span>

Faith Or (@faith-or) wrote a blog post on how they migrated from ember-wormhole to the built-in in-element helper introduced in Ember 3.20.
Ember Wormhole is an addon that renders a child view somewhere else in the DOM outside of the component.
The in-element helper renders its block content outside of the regular flow, into a DOM element given by its destinationElement positional argument.
Common use cases for both include when a piece of UI is a logical child of a component but needs to render somewhere else such as a loading screen, a modal, tooltip or even a dropdown. The diffe‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>After ten years of exceptional service to the Python Software Foundation, the PSF Executive Director Ewa Jodlowska has decided to leave the Foundation at the end of 2021. We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It‚Äôs safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa.
In preparation for Ewa‚Äôs departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission ‚Äúto promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.‚Äù
The Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.</span>

Annotated Assertions: Debugging With Joy
Ronny Pfannschmidt spoke about annotated assertions. He is a pytest maintainer and loves approachable debugging.
He compared assertions in unittest with assertions in pytest. He remarked that mistakes have been made in the past and are still being made today. Before pytest 2.1, pytest would reinterpret assertions, which was bad for side effects. Today, pytest deals with side effects by handling all of the variables, collecting them, and showing them to you.¬†
Here&#x27;s what he would like to see in Python:

What Is Testing?
For the purposes of this talk, he defined testing as the art and science of running code and then checking if it did what it was supposed to do. He added that, although assertions, type checkers, linters, and code review are good, they are not testing.
There are two general reasons why we might have tests:

For correctness:

The goal is to validate software and determine that they are no bugs.
Nondeterminism is acceptable.
Finding any fault is a success. 

For software engineering (programming, over time, in teams):

What Does the Community Need? 
When Eric Snow first got involved in core development over a decade ago, he liked that there was so much to learn. But he found that the organization didn&#x27;t offer a lot of direction in terms of guiding volunteers to the kind of work that would have the biggest impact.¬†
Over the years, he&#x27;s thought about how he and other contributors decide what to work on and why. What directs the efforts of contributors and core developers? Contributors make decisions based on their availability, expertise, and interests. Core developers need to act as s‚Ä¶</span>
