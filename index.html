                    <span>Victor Stinner and Dong-hee Na gave a presentation at the 2021 Python Language Summit about running multiple Python interpreters in parallel in the same process.
Use Cases 

Victor Stinner started by explaining why we would need to make the changes that they&#x27;re discussing. One use case would be if you wanted to embed Python and extend the features of your application, like Vim, Blender, LibreOffice, and pybind11. Another use case is subinterpreters. For example, to handle HTTP requests, there is Apache mod_…</span>

                    <span>PEP 654 was authored by Irit Katriel, Yury Selivanov, and Guido van Rossum. This PEP is currently at the draft stage. At the 2021 Python Language Summit, the authors shared what it is, why we need it, and which ideas they rejected.


 

What Is PEP 654?


The purpose of this PEP is to help Python users handle unrelated exceptions. Right now, if you&#x27;re dealing with several unrelated exceptions, you can:


Raise one exception and throw away the others, in which case you&#x27;re losing exceptions
