          "description": "After ten years of exceptional service to the Python Software Foundation, the PSF Executive Director Ewa Jodlowska has decided to leave the Foundation at the end of 2021. We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It’s safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa.\nIn preparation for Ewa’s departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission “to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.”\nThe Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.",

Coombs, Mark Shannon, and Tobias Kohn.\n\n\n\nAnnotated Assertions: Debugging With Joy\nRonny Pfannschmidt spoke about annotated assertions. He is a pytest maintainer and loves approachable debugging.\nHe compared assertions in unittest with assertions in pytest. He remarked that mistakes have been made in the past and are still being made today. Before pytest 2.1, pytest would reinterpret assertions, which was bad for side effects. Today, pytest deals with side effects by handling all of the variables, collecting them, and showing them to you. \nHere's what he would like to see in Python:\n\n\n\nHere's what he'd like to do:\n\nCr…",

He added that, although assertions, type checkers, linters, and code review are good, they are not testing.\nThere are two general reasons why we might have tests:\n\nFor correctness:\n\nThe goal is to validate software and determine that they are no bugs.\nNondeterminism is acceptable.\nFinding any fault is a success. \n\nFor software engineering (programming, over time, in teams):\n\nThe goal is to validate changes or detect regr…",
