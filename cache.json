          "description": "The PSF and the Python Steering Council are pleased to announce that the inaugural Developer-in-Residence role will be held by core developer ≈Åukasz Langa. \nCPython, the reference implementation of Python, is developed and primarily maintained by volunteers. Inspired by the Django Fellowship Program's success, the PSF has strategically planned to support CPython in a similar way beginning this year. Thanks to the support from sponsors such as Google, this effort is now being put into motion!¬†\n≈Åukasz will work full-time for one year to assist CPython maintainers and the Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will include analytical research to understand the project's volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project priorities and their tasks going forward, and begin working on those priorities. Regular reporting and full transparency to the community are also a large part of ≈Åukasz‚Äô role. If the program is impactful and the PSF raises enough funds, there is potential for the Developer-in-Residence role to continue beyond one year. We look forward to updating the community as work progresses!\nCheck out ≈Åukasz‚Äô personal announcement here.",

          "description": "After ten years of exceptional service to the Python Software Foundation, the PSF Executive Director Ewa Jodlowska has decided to leave the Foundation at the end of 2021. We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It‚Äôs safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa.\nIn preparation for Ewa‚Äôs departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission ‚Äúto promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.‚Äù\nThe Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.",

This is a minor version, stable release.\nWe're also announcing the start of the 3.28 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a stable release in six weeks' time. The ember-try addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.\nEmber.js 3.28 (again, starting beta today) is the final planned version of the 3.x release cycle, and will\nbecome an LTS release.
