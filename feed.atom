        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Django 4.0 alpha 1 is now available. It represents the first stage in the 4.0
release cycle and is an opportunity for you to try out the changes coming in
Django 4.0.
Django 4.0 has an abundance of new features which you can read about in the
in-development 4.0 release notes.
This alpha milestone marks the feature freeze. The current
release schedule calls for a beta release in about a month and a release
candidate about a month from then. We'll only be able to keep this schedule
if we get early and often testing from the community. Updates on the release
schedule are available on the django-developers mailing list.
As with all alpha and beta packages, this is not for production use. But
if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to the issue tracker), you can grab a
copy of the alpha package from our downloads page or on PyPI.
The PGP key ID used for this release is Mariusz Felisiak: 2EF56372BA48CD1B.]]></summary>

🎉 Ember 3.28 and 4.0 Beta Released
After 3.5 years and 28 minor releases, Ember 3.28 marks the end of the project's 3.x series. To ensure a smooth upgrade path going into the 4.x series, 3.28 has been declared an LTS (Long Term Support) candidate. In six weeks, the latest patch version of 3.28 will be promoted to be the latest LTS release and replace 3.24-LTS.

Release: ember-engines-router-service, ember-scroll-modifier and ember-user-activity updates, and Coding with the Dead on Twitch.
⚙️ Release: ember-engines-router-service
Michael Villander (@villander) released the ember-engines-router-service addon which provides the Router service for ember-engines.
The addon gives you access to the RouterService API inside each engine. This allows you to inject the router service as usual to your component within an engine and use APIs such as transitionTo and even transitionToExternal which help link externalRoutes together.
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from ‘@ember/object’;

export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
  @service router;
