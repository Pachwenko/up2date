Faith Or (@faith-or) wrote a blog post on how they migrated from ember-wormhole to the built-in in-element helper introduced in Ember 3.20.
Ember Wormhole is an addon that renders a child view somewhere else in the DOM outside of the component.
The in-element helper renders its block content outside of the regular flow, into a DOM element given by its destinationElement positional argument.
Common use cases for both include when a piece of UI is a logical child of a component but needs to render somewhere else such as a loading screen, a modal, tooltip or even a dropdown. The diffe…]]></summary>

We wish to thank Ewa for her many years of service and contributions to not only the Foundation but to the entire Python community. It’s safe to say the PSF, PyCon and the whole Python community would not be where it is today if not for Ewa.
In preparation for Ewa’s departure, the Python Software Foundation will begin a search to find a new Executive Director. The Executive Director is a key player in helping the Foundation pursue our mission “to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.”
The Board of Directors will work together with the Staff, the outgoing Executive Director, and the community in developing a timeline for the transition as well as posting periodic updates on the search when it formally begins. Please keep an eye on the PSF blog for these updates as well as the forthcoming job listing.]]></summary>

Annotated Assertions: Debugging With Joy
Ronny Pfannschmidt spoke about annotated assertions. He is a pytest maintainer and loves approachable debugging.
He compared assertions in unittest with assertions in pytest. He remarked that mistakes have been made in the past and are still being made today. Before pytest 2.1, pytest would reinterpret assertions, which was bad for side effects. Today, pytest deals with side effects by handling all of the variables, collecting them, and showing them to you. 
Here's what he would like to see in Python:

What Is Testing?
For the purposes of this talk, he defined testing as the art and science of running code and then checking if it did what it was supposed to do. He added that, although assertions, type checkers, linters, and code review are good, they are not testing.
There are two general reasons why we might have tests:

For correctness:

The goal is to validate software and determine that they are no bugs.
Nondeterminism is acceptable.
Finding any fault is a success. 

For software engineering (programming, over time, in teams):

What Does the Community Need? 
When Eric Snow first got involved in core development over a decade ago, he liked that there was so much to learn. But he found that the organization didn't offer a lot of direction in terms of guiding volunteers to the kind of work that would have the biggest impact. 
Over the years, he's thought about how he and other contributors decide what to work on and why. What directs the efforts of contributors and core developers? Contributors make decisions based on their availability, expertise, and interests. Core developers need to act as s…]]></summary>

What Is the stdlib? 

He succinctly described the stdlib as "a collection of modules that ship with CPython (usually)." This was the most accurate definition he could give, considering how big it is, how varied its contents are, and how long it has been around.
He didn't offer an answer to the question about whether or not there should be a new informational PEP to define clear goals for the stblib, but he wanted core developers to engage with the question. There are a variety of opinions on the stdlib, but it could be beneficial to come to some kind of agreement about:

Petr Viktorin spoke about the stable ABI and limited C API. The stable ABI is a way to compile a C extension on Python 3.x and run it on Python 3.x+. It was introduced in 2009 with PEP 384. You can use it to simplify extension maintenance, and it will allow you to support more versions. But it does have lower performance, and you can't do everything with it that you could with the full API.
Petr Viktorin would like to see it used for bindings and embeddings. If Python is just a small part of your application and you don't want to invest a lot of maintainer time into supporting Python, then that woul…]]></summary>

HPy is an alternative API for writing C extensions. Although the current Python C API shows CPython implementation details, HPy hides all the implementation details that would otherwise be exposed. Antonio Cuni said that, if everyone used HPy, then it would help Python evolve in the long term.
Using HPy extensions will make it easier to support alternative implementations. HPy is designed to be GC friendly and isn't build on top of ref counting. It is also designed to have zero overhead on CPython, so you can port an existing module from the Python…]]></summary>
