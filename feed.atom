🎉 Ember 3.28 and 4.0 Beta Released

Release: ember-engines-router-service, ember-scroll-modifier and ember-user-activity updates, and Coding with the Dead on Twitch.
⚙️ Release: ember-engines-router-service
Michael Villander (@villander) released the ember-engines-router-service addon which provides the Router service for ember-engines.
The addon gives you access to the RouterService API inside each engine. This allows you to inject the router service as usual to your component within an engine and use APIs such as transitionTo and even transitionToExternal which help link externalRoutes together.
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from ‘@ember/object’;

export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
  @service router;
