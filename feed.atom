🎉 Ember 3.28 and 4.0 Beta Released
After 3.5 years and 28 minor releases, Ember 3.28 marks the end of the project's 3.x series. To ensure a smooth upgrade path going into the 4.x series, 3.28 has been declared an LTS (Long Term Support) candidate. In six weeks, the latest patch version of 3.28 will be promoted to be the latest LTS release and replace 3.24-LTS.
We're also announcing the start of the Ember 4.0 beta cycle for all sub-projects. Following the process set in previous major versions, Ember 4.0's beta introduces no new features. Instead, it removes support for deprecated public APIs. We enco…]]></summary>

Release: ember-engines-router-service, ember-scroll-modifier and ember-user-activity updates, and Coding with the Dead on Twitch.
⚙️ Release: ember-engines-router-service
Michael Villander (@villander) released the ember-engines-router-service addon which provides the Router service for ember-engines.
The addon gives you access to the RouterService API inside each engine. This allows you to inject the router service as usual to your component within an engine and use APIs such as transitionTo and even transitionToExternal which help link externalRoutes together.
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import { action } from ‘@ember/object’;

export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
  @service router;
