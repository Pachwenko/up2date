The Road to Ember 4.0, introducing a11y-disabled-modifier, Emberliners talks, and get your update for ember-engines 0.8.18.
The Road to Ember 4.0 🛣
Matthew Beale (@mixonic) from the Ember Core Framework and Steering Committee teams, writes about The Road to Ember 4.0 on the official Ember blog.
Announcing Ember 4.0: Ember 4.0 will be released around September 20th. Ember 4.4 will be the first LTS candidate of the 4.x series.
Whats in a 4.0?: As a major version of Ember, there are no new features. This sections discusses the removal of deprecated APIs. For example, Ember.Logger is removed in favor of native console APIs. Also, sendAction is removed in favor of calling closure actions like any other callback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contributors to the Ember project have been hard at work since Ember Octane was released in December 2019.
Over the duration of a challenging (and sometimes devastating) year and a half, we've shipped a powerful new feature (Named Blocks) and supported an ecosystem shifting to Octane conventions. We've more closely aligned Ember with wider frontend conventions through improved publishing & build tooling (Embroider) and better support for TypeScript (both through ember-cli-typescript and reducing reliance on type-unsafe framework features).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The PSF and the Python Steering Council are pleased to announce that the inaugural Developer-in-Residence role will be held by core developer Łukasz Langa. 
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is developed and primarily maintained by volunteers. Inspired by the Django Fellowship Program's success, the PSF has strategically planned to support CPython in a similar way beginning this year. Thanks to the support from sponsors such as Google, this effort is now being put into motion! 
Łukasz will work full-time for one year to assist CPython maintainers and the Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will include analytical research to understand the project's volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project priorities and their tasks going forward, and begin working on those priorities. Regular reporting and full transparency to the community are also a large part of Łukasz’ role. If the program is impactful and the PSF raises enough funds, there is potential for the Developer-in-Residence role to continue beyond one year. We look forward to updating the community as work progresses!
Check out Łukasz’ personal announcement here.]]></summary>
